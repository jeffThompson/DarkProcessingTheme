Dark Processing Theme
===================

Wasted much of a day building a dark theme for the Processing IDE - a little easier on the eyes!

\- \- \-

####INSTALLATION
1. **PREFERENCES.TXT**  
Replace your `preferences.txt` with mine - note the only main change is setting `editor.antialias` to true, which makes your fonts look WAY better!  Note that this can also be accomplished using the Preferences menu in the IDE.
2. **THEME FOLDER**  
Look in `~/Applications/Processing.app/Contents/Resources/Java/Modes` and in the folder of the Mode you want to change (ie: Java, JavaScript, Android, etc).  Replace the `theme` folder inside (making a copy of the original in case you hate my changes!)
This folder contains a 'themes.txt' file with the bulk of the changes (mostly colors)  
Buttons and tabs are stored as image files, which have been modified to fit the color scheme
3. **SCREENSHOT**  
Self-explanatory :)

####PSD 'BUTTONS' FILE
The `theme` folder also includes a Photoshop (.psd) file for the buttons which includes a saved selection for easier changing of the background.  This can be accessed through the 'Channels' panel.
